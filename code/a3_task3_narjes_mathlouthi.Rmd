## Overview

This code wrangles then visualizes data of exports of plastic debris by rivers into the sea. The data represents global compilation of plastic debris in the water column across a wide range of river sizes. Plastic debris loads, both microplastic (particles <5 mm) and macroplastic (particles >5 mm) are positively related to the mismanaged plastic waste (MMPW) generated in the river catchments.
